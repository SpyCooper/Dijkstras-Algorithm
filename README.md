# Dijkstra's Algorithm
This is my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest distance path. This was a project for my data structures class that I took in spring of 2023.
Some of the code was given to us from our textbook, however I had to change a good portion of it to fit how I was implementing the code and problem as a whole.

# To run the program
To compile the code, you need to run the command "g++ main.cc graph.cc" to compile the code. Then to run the program, you need to do "./a.exe" amd then you can type in the inputs manually through the terminal, or how I was doing it on WSL was to put the input file (ex:input1.dat) into the same location as the a.out file and running the command "./a.out < input1.dat"
